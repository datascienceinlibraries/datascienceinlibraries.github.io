As librarians increasingly use, build, and maintain the National Digital Platform, the skills to manipulate, analyze, and manage data are crucial. Librarians will need to leverage the tools and techniques of data science, but they currently face two significant challenges:

1. The Skills Gap ­ While practicing mid­-career librarians are learning some data science skills, it is through ad­hoc, uncoordinated continuing education programs.
2. The Management Gap ­ Library administrators need toolkits and frameworks to strategically leverage data science for data­ driven decision making and management of library operations.

Our goal is to coalesce diverse and disparate communities whose experiences and perspectives on data science inspire and contribute to developing and sustaining our National Digital Platform. We are at a critical moment where a plethora of opportunities and promises around data science need to be thoughtfully and strategically applied in libraries.
